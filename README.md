<!-- TEA SPILL -->

## üåù Tea Spill
Creating this calculator was SUPER fun because it was my first time using useReducer. It was challenging to figure out that I could pass the dispatch through props of components, and how to pass the payload through calling that dispatch in the component. The HARDEST part of this project was the logic of the calculator, for example, thinking about edge cases such as handling when someone presses multiple 0's, they shouldn't appear on the screen because a standard calculator will only allow you to enter one zero if that's the only integer on the screen. I watched a tutorial to make sure I was catching the most common edge cases.
